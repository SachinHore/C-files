/*
Write a C program to find the grace marks for a student using switch. 
The user should enter the class obtained by the student and the number of subjects he has failed in. Use the following logic:
-- If the student gets first class and the number of subjects, 
	he failed in is greater than 3, then he does not get any grace. 
	Otherwise, the grace is of 5 marks per subject.
-- If the student gets second class and the number of subjects, 
	he failed in is greater than 2, then he does not get any grace. 
	Otherwise, the grace is of 4 marks per subject.
-- If the student gets third class and the number of subjects, 
	he failed in is greater than 1, then he does not get any grace. 
	Otherwise, the grace is of 5 marks per subject.
